# Google Drive API Endpoints Documentation

This document provides details on the available API endpoints for integrating Google Drive with your Django application. The APIs allow users to upload files to Google Drive, list their Google Drive files, and download files from Google Drive.

## Postman Collection

To test these APIs in Postman:
1. Open Postman and create a new request.
2. Set the request type (POST/GET) and URL.
3. Add the Authorization token in the headers.
4. For upload, use form-data to attach a file.
5. Send the request and check the response.

---

## Notes
- Ensure the user has authenticated and linked their Google Drive account before using these APIs.
- The download endpoint fetches files from Google Drive and stores them in the serverâ€™s `media/downloads` directory.
- The API uses OAuth tokens for Google Drive authentication, stored in the `GoogleDriveToken` model.
